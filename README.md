JavaScript Programs for Car Speed, Student Marks, and Net Salary Calculation
This repository contains three JavaScript-only programs designed to solve different tasks using user inputs. These programs can be run in an environment such as JSFiddle for demonstration purposes.

Programs Overview
1. Student Marks to Grade Converter
Description: This program determines a student's grade based on their marks (0–100).
Grading System:
A: Greater than 79
B: 60–79
C: 50–59
D: 40–49
E: Less than 40
Input Validation: Ensures the marks are between 0 and 100.
2. Car Speed and Demerit Points
Description: This program calculates the demerit points for a driver based on the car's speed.
If the speed is less than 70 km/h, it prints "Ok".
For every 5 km/h above 70, it assigns 1 demerit point.
If the driver accumulates more than 12 points, it prints "License suspended".
Input Validation: Ensures the speed entered is a valid number.
3. Net Salary Calculator
Description: This program calculates an individual's net salary based on:
Inputs: Basic salary and benefits.
Outputs:
Gross salary.
Payee (Tax).
NHIF deductions.
NSSF deductions.
Net salary.
Details: Tax rates and deductions are based on KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values.
